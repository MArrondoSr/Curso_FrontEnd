00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:10.600
I was digging in the yard today When
I letter came from Southampton way

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:17.800
Keep on working, keep on working 
I must admit I was a bit in the red

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:25.000
If you never had a pleasure, then you could
be dead Keep on working, keep on working

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:31.208
Keep on working, keep on working 
But there's one thing,

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:35.000
they can take away 
Hear the sea sing, see a smiling face
